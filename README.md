# kalyan1210.github.io


Personal site for **Sai Kalyan Yalla**, hosted with **GitHub Pages** and **Jekyll**.


## How it works
- GitHub Pages builds the site from the `main` branch
- Jekyll config lives in `_config.yml`
- The home page uses a custom layout at `_layouts/home.html`
- `index.md` selects that layout


## Local edits
You can edit files directly on GitHub and the Pages workflow will rebuild automatically. No Ruby setup is required for these simple changes.


## Tips
- Keep a `headshot.jpg` at the repo root
- Add `Sai_Kalyan_Yalla_CV.pdf` if you want the CV link to work
- If you used a `.nojekyll` file earlier, delete it to enable Jekyll
